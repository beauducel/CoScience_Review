for each analysis there is one folder containing the relevant Questionnaire data which have been forked
these files were created outside (see folder Questionnaire_Prep)

There are mostly 8 files:

four csv files contain all possible forks for defining the personality variables or the covariates.
the "-filtered" refers to the procedure where - before calculating any scores - items were excluded if participants
did not answer the attention checks correctly or responded too fast.
the -"outliers-removed" refers to applying mahalanobis distance to the scores to determine deviations and outliers
Personality-Scores-filtered_outliers-notremoved
Personality-Scores-filtered_outliers-removed
Personality-Scores-unfiltered_outliers-notremoved
Personality-Scores-unfiltered_outliers-removed

It also contains four (probably similar) csv files printing the output of the factor analysis
for each of the four possibilites (outliers removed/notremoved and data filtered/unfiltered)
