  "TaskName": "GoNoGo",
  "TaskDescription": "During the Go-NoGo task, participant have to respond to certain visual cues (Go trials), while withholding response to others (NoGo trials). Squares or circles are used as stimuli, the assignment to Go and NoGo stimuli is counterbalanced across subjects. Go trials are presented more frequently (66 %) than NoGo trials, the order is randomized across all block. Each block consists of 252 trials. Participants complete a short practice and then two blocks of the task, that only differ in their instructions: In the first task block, participants are instructed to perform as fast and correct as possible. In the second block, participants are instructed that they should be as relaxed as possible, while responding correctly, and that relaxation is more important than correct performance. The order of the blocks is counterbalanced across participants.",
