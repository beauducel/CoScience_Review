  "TaskName": "Gambling",
  "TaskDescription": "During the Gambling task, participants are first informed about how much money is at stake, i.e., the magnitude of the potential loss or win, (0, 10, or 50 cents), before they see a number and have to guess if a second hidden card is larger or smaller than the current one. Unbeknownst to the participant, both feedback types (win vs. loss) are presented equally often. Participants do a short practice (15 trials) and four blocks of the task (61 trials each). In most trials, participants are shown a 4 or 5 (102 trials each), and only in 40 other trials participants see another numbers (2, 3, 6, 7, 8, eight trials each). Across all blocks, reward/loss magnitude as well as feedback outcome is presented equally often and in randomized order. ",
