  "TaskDescription": "During this version of the UltimatumGame Game, participants first act as proposer and make offers to get acquainted with the procedure. However, the important phase is when participants act as responder, receiving offers (supposedly by other participants) and having to choose if they accept it (and get the money) or reject it (and nobody gets the money). Offers vary in their fairness level (9:1, i.e. proposer receives 9 cents, responder only 1 cent, 5:5 or 7:3). Each offer is presented 25 times in randomized order across the three blocks.",
