  "TaskName": "Resting",
  "TaskDescription": "Eight 1-min resting recordings of EEG and ECG are obtained (with alternating 1-min recordings with eyes open and closed). A tone is played for 500ms when a change occurs. Furthermore, this procedure is repeated twice throughout the experiment. Therefore, this task manipulates two factors within subject: (1) Eyes open vs. Eyes closed and (2) Repetition (first, second or third run). Order of blocks is counterbalanced across subjects and repetitions.",
